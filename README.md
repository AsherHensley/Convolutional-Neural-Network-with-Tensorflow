Experimenting with Tensorflow for Iceberg Classification

This is a basic Python script I've been experimenting with for an old Kaggle competition on iceberg classification. I started with the Tensorflow MNIST tutorial and modified it so that I could configure the number/depth of convolutional layers, the kernel sizes, max-pooling stages, and the number of fully connected layers from the same place. Right now it's set up to partition the training data into a train and validation set and plot each learning curve after running backprop. The next step is to setup cross validation for model selection.
